# DataSanitized

## Overview
**DataSanitized** is a meticulously curated repository of pre-processed datasets, stripped of inconsistencies, anomalies, and redundancies. This resource provides high-quality, structured data suitable for advanced analysis, model training, and research applications, ensuring seamless integration into data pipelines and analytical workflows.

## Purpose
Handling raw datasets often requires significant preprocessing before they can be used for meaningful analysis or model training. **DataSanitized** simplifies this process by offering cleaned, well-structured datasets along with detailed preprocessing steps and exploratory data analysis (EDA) reports.

This repository is aimed at:
- **Data Scientists & Analysts** – For high-quality datasets ready for modeling.
- **Machine Learning Practitioners** – For pre-processed data suitable for training models.
- **Researchers** – To use structured data for analysis and experiments.
- **Students & Enthusiasts** – To learn and practice preprocessing and EDA techniques.

## Repository Structure
The repository follows a consistent folder structure to maintain clarity and usability. Each dataset has its own directory containing:

```
/dataset_name/
│── raw_data.csv / raw_data.xlsx          # Original, unprocessed dataset
│── data_preprocessing.ipynb              # Jupyter Notebook with preprocessing steps
│── data_cleaned.csv / data_cleaned.xlsx  # Cleaned dataset after preprocessing
│── data_eda.ipynb                        # Jupyter Notebook with EDA insights
```

### File Descriptions
1. **raw_data.csv / raw_data.xlsx** – The original dataset before preprocessing.
2. **data_preprocessing.ipynb** – A Jupyter Notebook that includes:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Removing duplicates and outliers.
   - Feature scaling and transformation.
   - Other necessary preprocessing steps.
3. **data_cleaned.csv / data_cleaned.xlsx** – The final dataset after cleaning.
4. **data_eda.ipynb** – A Jupyter Notebook that includes:
   - Statistical summary of data.
   - Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, etc.).
   - Correlation analysis and feature importance.
   - Any patterns, trends, or anomalies discovered in the data.
